                        <p>
                            <span>My parents gave me my first PC while I was in Kindergarten and since then I'm hooked and interested in the inner workings of computers. </span>
                            <span>It didn't take long until I unscrewed it and took it apart, but after my third computer, it also worked after I reassembled it. :) </span>
                            <span>I don't know how often I (re-) installed <span class="keyword">Windows 98</span> on it, but it was every few months.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I taught myself programming, in the beginning with simple Windows <span class="keyword">Batch</span> scripts and later with <span class="keyword">AutoIt</span>. </span>
                            <span>When I was <span class="keyword">13</span> years old I started playing <span class="keyword">Minecraft</span> a lot, hosted my servers and started learning <span class="keyword">Java</span>. </span>
                            <span>I used <span class="keyword">Java</span> for custom plugins to manage my server and add features for the players there. </span>
                            <span>This was my gateway into object-oriented programming. I learned the concepts surrounding it and how I could use it. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Aged <span class="keyword">17</span>, I finished secondary school and started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development. </span>
                            <span>During my first year there I started working on a big project for over four years, which is a management system for vehicle keys. </span>
                            <span>It was an investment of over <span class="keyword">700.000 â‚¬</span> in hardware alone and is running since <span class="keyword">2017</span> very stable. It has been extended and maintained since then. </span>
                            <span>I made most of the decisions and developed for example a custom bus communication protocol between the boxes used for storing the vehicle keys. </span>
                            <span>Wrote the <span class="keyword">firmware</span> on them and created the schematic for the <span class="keyword">PCBs</span>. </span>
                            <span>The system uses <span class="keyword">ASP.NET Framework</span> as a centralized Server, Windows touch clients for user input, a background service for connecting the boxes, a fingerprint and a vehicle key reader with the server. </span>
                            <span>For data storage, I used <span class="keyword">Microsoft SQL</span>, <span class="keyword">Mongo DB</span> and a self-made automatic in-memory caching system witch creates indexes on every tuple value. </span>
                            <span>This way it runs extremely fast and has no problem keeping up with hundreds of thousands of in-memory queries per second. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>The whole system was designed and developed from the ground up by me. </span>
                            <span>My colleagues and I put up and rolled it out in our multiple branches and after that, we trained our employees. </span>
                            <span>With this project, I experienced the whole process of designing, building, expanding and maintaining a more or less complex software project witch also involves custom made hardware. </span>
                            <span>I can do nothing but thank my employer for this great chance I  could grow. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Looking back I would change a few decisions I made but didn't know better. </span>
                            <span>At this time I also got my current degree in computer science as a <span class="keyword">Computer Science Expert</span> in the subject area of <span class="keyword">Application Development</span>.</span>
