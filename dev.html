                            <span>I'm Felix Mayer, a software developer, born in <span class="keyword">1998</span> and living in <span class="keyword">Ottobeuren</span> (near Memmingen, Germany). I started programming at an early age and have done it as a time expensive hobby since <span class="keyword">2013</span>. </span>
                            <span>I gathered over four years of full-time experience as a professional full-stack developer and still working on personal projects in my spare time.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I love <span class="keyword variable">low-level</span> and hardware related technologies and building custom tools and libraries. On the other hand, I also admire <span class="keyword variable">high-level</span> concepts like JavaScript or TypeScript.</span>

                            <span>My parents gave me my first PC while I was in Kindergarten, and since then, I've been hooked and interested in the inner workings of computers. </span>
                            <span>It didn't take long until I unscrewed it and took it apart, but after my third computer, it also worked after I reassembled it. :) </span>
                            <span>I don't know how often I (re-) installed <span class="keyword">Windows 98</span> on it, but it was every few months. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I taught myself programming, in the beginning with simple Windows <span class="keyword">Batch</span> scripts and later with <span class="keyword">AutoIt</span>. </span>
                            <span>When I was <span class="keyword">13</span> years old, I started playing <span class="keyword">Minecraft</span> a lot. I hosted my servers and started learning <span class="keyword">Java</span>. </span>
                            <span>I used <span class="keyword">Java</span> for custom plugins to manage my server and add features for the players there. That was my gateway into <span class="keyword variable">object-oriented programming</span>. </span>
                            <span>I learned the concepts surrounding it and how I could use it. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I finished secondary school and started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development in <span class="keyword">2015</span>. </span>
                            <span>During my first year there, I started working on a big project for managing vehicle keys. I worked on it for over four years and was an investment of over <span class="keyword">700.000â‚¬</span> in hardware alone. </span>
                            <span>It has been extended and maintained since <span class="keyword">2017</span> and is running pretty stable. </span>
                            <span>I made most of the decisions and developed, for example, a custom bus communication protocol between the boxes used for storing the vehicle keys. Wrote the firmware on them and created the schematic for the PCBs. </span>
                            <span>The system uses <span class="keyword">ASP.NET Framework</span> as a centralized Server, Windows touch clients for user input, a background service for connecting the boxes, a fingerprint and a vehicle key reader with the server. </span>
                            <span>For data storage, I used <span class="keyword">Microsoft SQL</span>, <span class="keyword">Mongo DB</span> and a self-made automatic in-memory caching system witch creates indexes on every tuple value. </span>
                            <span>This way, it runs extremely fast and has no problem keeping up with hundreds of thousands of in-memory queries per second. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I designed and developed the whole system from the ground up. </span>
                            <span>My colleagues and I put it up and rolled it out in our multiple branches. After that, we trained our employees. </span>
                            <span>With this project, I experienced the whole process of <span class="keyword variable">designing</span>, <span class="keyword variable">building</span>, <span class="keyword variable">expanding</span> and <span class="keyword variable">maintaining</span> a more or less complex software project witch also involves custom made hardware. </span>
                            <span>I can do nothing but thank my colleagues and employer for this great work and for the chance I could <span class="keyword green">grow</span>. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Looking back, I would do a few things differently. But I didn't know it better at that time. </span>
                            <span>I completed my current degree in computer science as a <span class="keyword">Computer Science Expert</span> in the subject area of <span class="keyword">Application Development</span>. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I quit my job as a <span class="keyword variable">full-stack developer</span> in <span class="keyword">2019</span> to go back to school and get <span class="keyword variable">high school graduation</span>. </span>
                            <span>Currently, I'm <span class="keyword variable">studying</span> <span class="keyword">Computer Science</span> at the university of applied science in <span class="keyword">Kempten</span>. </span>
                            <span>But in my semester breaks, I get back to my old colleagues and employer to improve my project and earn some money. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I'm looking with curiosity into the future and trying to grow my skillset until then. <span class="keyword green">:)</span> </span>
                        </p>
