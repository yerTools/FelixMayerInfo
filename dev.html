                        <p>
                            <span>I'm Felix Mayer, a passionate software developer, born in <span class="keyword">1998</span> and living in <span class="keyword">Ottobeuren</span> (near Memmingen, Germany). </span>
                            <span>I started programming at an early age and have done it as a time expensive hobby since <span class="keyword">2013</span>. I gathered over <span class="keyword variable">four years</span> of full-time experience as a professional full-stack developer and still working on personal projects in my <span class="keyword variable">spare time</span>. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I love <span class="keyword variable">low-level</span> and hardware related technologies and building custom tools and libraries. On the other hand, I also admire <span class="keyword variable">high-level</span> concepts like JavaScript or TypeScript. </span>
                            <span>I'm <span class="keyword important">enthusiastic</span> about the genius design of computers and programming languages controlling their execution order. </span>
                            <span>That's why I build computers with <span class="keyword variable">integrated circuits</span> and Redstone in Minecraft. Furthermore, I wrote a little <span class="keyword variable">programming langue</span> with a <span class="keyword variable">cross-compiler</span> into web assembly. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I'm not a big fan of external dependencies for my code. Because of this, I often write my very own libraries and helpers, which get the job done well. </span>
                            <span>I must be able to <span class="keyword variable">understand</span>, <span class="keyword variable">maintain</span>, <span class="keyword variable">customize</span> and <span class="keyword variable">extend</span> the code I engineer. In my experience, this is the best and fastest way to achieve this goal. </span>
                            <span><span class="keyword">This page</span> is a neat example of this attitude. I didn't use any external libraries for graphics, styling or frameworks. </span>
                            <span>If you find a <span data-glitch-text="BUG" class="glitch-3 keyword important">bug</span>, I'll be able to fix it. <span class="keyword green">;)</span> </span>

                        <h4>Languages</h4>
                        <p>
                            <span>Besides my speaking and typing abilities in both <span class="keyword">English</span> and <span class="keyword">German</span>, I also can write languages a computer is capable of understanding. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>AVR Assembly</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar light-orange">
                            <div style="width: 60%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>I only had the pleasure to use the <span class="keyword">AVR Instruction Set</span> while working on a <span class="keyword variable">professional</span> project, but I <span class="keyword variable">quite liked it</span>. Before that, I'd never written any assembly instructions. </span>
                            <span>But after a few weeks, I was really into it. It's perfect for low-level and internet of things related edge computers. If you need to be in control of every bit, it's precisely the right choice. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>C/C++</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar yellow">
                            <div style="width: 70%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>I know enough about these languages that I can write programs in them <span class="keyword variable">with ease</span>. Not many languages beat their performance. </span>
                            <span>That's the reason I used them both for <span class="keyword variable">private</span> and <span class="keyword variable">work-related</span> projects. Besides that, I prefer C# because it's easier to <span class="keyword variable">develop</span> and <span class="keyword variable">maintain</span>. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>C#</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar light-green">
                            <div style="width: 90%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>I used C# for both <span class="keyword variable">professional</span> and <span class="keyword variable">private</span> projects alike. I've taken a deep dive into the language throughout the last <span class="keyword variable">seven years</span>. </span>
                            <span>Through the help of decompiles, I also gathered a good understanding of some inner workings of built-in libraries. I began with version <span class="keyword">6.0</span> of the language and went with time to the current C# <span class="keyword">10</span> standard. </span>
                            <span>I'm feeling <span class="keyword variable">very confident</span> using it not only for small but also for large scale projects. That's why it's my go-to language for many tasks. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>HTML/CSS/SCSS</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar green">
                            <div style="width: 80%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>Even though these aren't my favourite languages, I'm sure I've got a <span class="keyword variable">pretty solid familiarity</span>. I think they are sometimes unnecessary complicated, but I know how to get them right. </span>
                            <span>I worked both in <span class="keyword variable">private</span> and in a <span class="keyword variable">professional</span> environment with them. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>Java</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar light-orange">
                            <div style="width: 55%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>Nowadays, I'm not up to date with the latest feature of the language, but I've got a <span class="keyword variable">solid base</span>. It was my gateway into object-oriented programming and my career. </span>
                            <span>But after I discovered C#, I'm only using it rarely. I've still got my <span class="keyword">Minecraft</span> server and am writing my <span class="keyword variable">plugins</span> in it, but other than that, I haven't found any use for it. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>Python</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar orange">
                            <div style="width: 30%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>I wouldn't call myself a Python developer. Over the last few years, I used it from time to time for small programs. </span>
                            <span>I'm sure I can get <span class="keyword variable">comfortable</span> with it after a few more days of reading into it. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>SQL</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar green">
                            <div style="width: 75%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            <span>I <span class="keyword variable">appreciate</span> the concepts and technologies surrounding it. I'm <span class="keyword variable">pretty confident</span> in <span class="keyword variable">using</span> and <span class="keyword variable">optimizing</span> queries to get precisely the data I need at an optimal speed. </span>
                            <span>I think SQL is an excellent tool. I used it not only <span class="keyword variable">professionally</span> but also in many <span class="keyword variable">private</span> programs. Though I nowadays believe Mongo DB is predominantly better. </span>
                        </p>

                        <h5>TypeScript/JavaScript</h5>
                        <div class="loading-bar light-green">
                            <div style="width: 95%;"></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>

                            <span>TypeScript is currently my <span class="keyword important">favourite</span> programming language of them all. After using JavaScript <span class="keyword variable">private</span> and <span class="keyword variable">professionally</span> for many years and <span class="keyword variable">teaching</span> friends programming with it, I switched to TypeScript after a good friend recommended it. </span>
                            <span>Now I wouldn't like to switch back. It's a <span class="keyword variable">strongly typed</span> language that compiles into JavaScript. That's why it's perfect for big web projects. </span>
                            <span>A problem I see with this language is that it looks like another C language when it isn't. It's a <span class="keyword variable">dynamic</span> scripting language with <span class="keyword variable">fluid type</span> conversions. </span>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div id="page-my-personal-history" class="half-page text-page">
                    <div class="content">
                        <h2>My Personal History</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content dark">
                        <p>
                            <span>My parents gave me my first PC while I was in Kindergarten, and since then, I've been hooked and interested in the inner workings of computers. </span>
                            <span>It didn't take long until I unscrewed it and took it apart, but after my third computer, it also worked after I reassembled it. :) </span>
                            <span>I don't know how often I (re-) installed <span class="keyword">Windows 98</span> on it, but it was every few months. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I taught myself programming, in the beginning with simple Windows <span class="keyword">Batch</span> scripts and later with <span class="keyword">AutoIt</span>. </span>
                            <span>When I was <span class="keyword">13</span> years old, I started playing <span class="keyword">Minecraft</span> a lot. I hosted my servers and started learning <span class="keyword">Java</span>. </span>
                            <span>I used <span class="keyword">Java</span> for custom plugins to manage my server and add features for the players there. That was my gateway into <span class="keyword variable">object-oriented programming</span>. </span>
                            <span>I learned the concepts surrounding it and how I could use it. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I finished secondary school and started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development in <span class="keyword">2015</span>. </span>
                            <span>During my first year there, I started working on a big project for managing vehicle keys. I worked on it for over four years and was an investment of over <span class="keyword">700.000€</span> in hardware alone. </span>
                            <span>It has been extended and maintained since <span class="keyword">2017</span> and is running pretty stable. </span>
                            <span>I made most of the decisions and developed, for example, a custom bus communication protocol between the boxes used for storing the vehicle keys. Wrote the firmware on them and created the schematic for the PCBs. </span>
                            <span>The system uses <span class="keyword">ASP.NET Framework</span> as a centralized Server, Windows touch clients for user input, a background service for connecting the boxes, a fingerprint and a vehicle key reader with the server. </span>
                            <span>For data storage, I used <span class="keyword">Microsoft SQL</span>, <span class="keyword">Mongo DB</span> and a self-made automatic in-memory caching system witch creates indexes on every tuple value. </span>
                            <span>This way, it runs extremely fast and has no problem keeping up with hundreds of thousands of in-memory queries per second. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I designed and developed the whole system from the ground up. </span>
                            <span>My colleagues and I put it up and rolled it out in our multiple branches. After that, we trained our employees. </span>
                            <span>With this project, I experienced the whole process of <span class="keyword variable">designing</span>, <span class="keyword variable">building</span>, <span class="keyword variable">expanding</span> and <span class="keyword variable">maintaining</span> a more or less complex software project witch also involves custom made hardware. </span>
                            <span>I can do nothing but thank my colleagues and employer for this great work and for the chance I could <span class="keyword green">grow</span>. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Looking back, I would do a few things differently. But I didn't know it better at that time. </span>
                            <span>I completed my current degree in computer science as a <span class="keyword">Computer Science Expert</span> in the subject area of <span class="keyword">Application Development</span> there. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I quit my job as a <span class="keyword variable">full-stack developer</span> in <span class="keyword">2019</span> to go back to school and get <span class="keyword variable">high school graduation</span>. </span>
                            <span>Currently, I'm <span class="keyword variable">studying</span> <span class="keyword">Computer Science</span> at the university of applied science in <span class="keyword">Kempten</span>. </span>
                            <span>But in my semester breaks, I get back to my old colleagues and employer to improve my project and earn some money. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I'm looking with curiosity into the future and trying to grow my skillset until then. <span class="keyword green">:)</span> </span>
