                        <p>
                            <span>My parents gave me my first PC while I was in Kindergarten and since then I was hooked and interested in the inner workings of computers. </span>
                            <span>It didn't take long until I opened it and took it apart but after my third computer, it also worked after I reassembled it. :) </span>
                            <span>I don't know how often I (re-) installed <span class="keyword">Windows 98</span> on it, but it was every few months.</span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>I taught myself programming, in the beginning with simple Windows <span class="keyword">Batch</span> scripts and later with <span class="keyword">AutoIt</span>. </span>
                            <span>At the age of <span class="keyword">13</span>, I started playing <span class="keyword">Minecraft</span> a lot, hosted my servers and started learning <span class="keyword">Java</span>. </span>
                            <span>I used <span class="keyword">Java</span> for custom plugins to manage my server and add features for the players on it. </span>
                            <span>This was my gateway into object-oriented programming and I learned the concepts surrounding it. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>At the age of <span class="keyword">17</span>, I finished secondary school and started an apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development. </span>
                            <span>In the first year there I started working on a big project for over four years which is a management system for vehicle keys. </span>
                            <span>It was an investment of over <span class="keyword">700.000â‚¬</span> in hardware alone and is running since <span class="keyword">2017</span> very stable and has been extended since then. </span>
                            <span>I made most of the decisions and developed a custom bus communication protocol between the boxes used for storing the vehicle keys. </span>
                            <span></span>
                            <span>This is how I got my current degree in computer science as a <span class="keyword">Computer Science Expert</span> with the subject area of <span class="keyword">Application Development</span>. </span>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span>Currently I'm studying <span class="keyword">Computer Science</span> at the university of applied science in <span class="keyword">Kempten</span>. </span>
